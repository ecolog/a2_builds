**A2 Operating System [A2 OS home page](http://cas.inf.ethz.ch/projects/a2) - former AOS (Active Objects System) / Bluebottle OS, modular Operating System written on high level Active Oberon programming language with a few amount of assembly code. A2 OS may run on a bare hardware or as application under Win / Linux / Darwin OS.**

**Active Oberon programming language ([ETH Oberon (2019) Language Report](http://cas.inf.ethz.ch/projects/a2/repository/raw/trunk/LanguageReport/OberonLanguageReport.pdf)) - result of evolution of Oberon-2 programming language, that encapsulates multithreading and synchronization primitives by utilizing concept of Active Objects and Exclusive / Await blocks. Also Active Oberon programming language includes such modern features as operator overloading, generics and mathematical matrix extentions.**
